# Clash Royale Bot using OpenCV

**Status:** In Development

## Overview

This project aims to develop a bot capable of playing the popular mobile game **Clash Royale** by utilizing computer vision techniques through **OpenCV**. The bot analyzes the game screen in real-time to make strategic decisions and execute actions automatically.
However I did not find a good dataset for all the 'cards' in the game and I cant be botherd to collect that myself. So it appears that we are postopnding this endevour for a bit.

## Features

- **Real-Time Screen Capture:** Continuously captures the game screen for analysis.
- **Image Processing with OpenCV:** Processes the captured images to detect game elements such as cards, troops, and enemy movements.
- **Automated Decision-Making: (Smart Decision-Making Not Implmented Yet)** Implements algorithms to decide the best moves based on the current game state.
- **Simulated User Input:** Sends touch inputs to the game to deploy troops and cast spells.
